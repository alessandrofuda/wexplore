We want for our clients to be our primary Compliance Officers, and for them to define the standards of our work. <br><br>


<em>Diversity&Inclusion</em><br>
Wexplore Srl stems from a strong international and intercultural vocation. We want to live this value starting from within. The Company therefore promotes and encourages all the processes and operative decisions which allow to be in touch with people from a diverse cultural background, with whom to achieve innovative forms of synergy. Additionally, the Company also commits to spread its specific know-how in associations and addressing younger generations, in order to ensure that the international experiences they are about to live will generate enrichment and personal growth. <br><br>


<em>Continuous Improvement and Innovation</em><br>
Wexplore Srl believes that continuous learning and the implementation of improvements and innovations are necessary conditions to work at one’s best level and to sustain business continuity, by creating new solutions aimed to address the evolutions and changes in the market and in Stakeholders’ needs.

We believe that being certified in the commercial application of Hofstede’s Models implies the moral duty and the motivation to respect the scientific foundations of our core methodology, and to propose solutions and interventions that mirror and are aligned with such a research-based approach. We further believe that our activities aimed at valuing and managing organizational culture demands that we develop our own corporate culture according to our work principles. <br><br>

<em>Value</em><br> 
All our values (Quality, Diversity, Learning and Coherence) uphold our key aspiration: to create tangible value for all Stakeholders, Clients, Companies and People, and the communities in which they work and live. Each of these fundamental principles should be expressed in a flexible and pragmatic way, and be implemented in such a way as to have the enhancing and transformational impact expected by those who come into contact with our Company. <br><br>

<em>Confidentiality</em><br>
The Company protects the privacy of all Stakeholders and the confidentiality of the information and personal data entrusted to it: all activities concerning data collection, archiving, and treatment may be conducted only by expressly authorized people, operating under the direct authority of the owner, and who shall not make any use of such information for any other purpose than those connected to the Company’s activities.

<em>Transparency</em> <br>
The Company conforms to the principle of transparency in the way it operates, communicates, and informs. Such principle is a crucial element to maintain reliability towards internal and external Stakeholders, and is applicable in particular:<br>
- In company governance and in contractual relationships, whether with Clients, Providers, Employees or Partners, which must be fair, clear, and verifiable;<br>
- In determining the costs for the offered services, which must be clearly expressed;<br>
- In the communication of information about the Company, which must equally be truthful, simple, understandable, timely, and accessible to everyone. 
It is part of the Company’s policy to negotiate in good faith and in all transparency with every potential client and provider. Only Wexplore Srl’s legal representative may negotiate any changes in the pricing policy, or in the terms and conditions of the stipulated contracts.<br><br>

Furthermore, Wexplore Srl upholds the principle of maximum transparency in transactions, operating in such a way as to contrast money laundering or trade of stolen goods.

All employees and associates are asked not only to scrupulously observe the applicable norms and specific procedures related to their role, but also to commit to proactively coach and lead by example their colleagues, acting as representatives of a culture of safety in the workplace. For the Company, this means protecting the work conditions of all resources, both in terms of their psychological and physical wellbeing, as well as in terms of their dignity.

Wexplore Srl commits to do its share in protecting the environment and in contributing to the sustainable development of the territory through the use of the best available technologies and the constant monitoring of company processes, in order to ensure energy saving and the lowest possible fuel consumption for the travel of its people.
