Yet how do we know what works better for us among those potentially infinite possibilities? How do we find the direction to our own safe harbor if we are sailing in the middle of the ocean, with no reference point?<br>
Can you really afford a trial-and-error approach, or isn’t it better to know from the beginning where you are most likely to have the most satisfactory job experience?<br>
With our Global Orientation Test, you will know which kind of companies and which countries better match your values and preferences…and use this information to gain points during a job interview!<br>
Together with the Test, we have another gift for you: the European Labour Market Maps, for a first overview of the occupational situation in Europe.</span>

Our goal is to make the process easier, and by being included in our network it can happen that potential employers ask us for talented profiles. however, we would be dishonest if we promised this for everyone.

This is derived from a tested methodology, by which it is more effective to focus your energies and efforts on one very clear target at the time.<br>
